abstract: 'In this work, we present a specific case study where we aim to design effective
  treatment allocation strategies and validate these using a mouse model of skin cancer.
  Collecting data for modelling treatments effectiveness on animal models is an expensive
  and time consuming process. Moreover, acquiring this information during the full
  range of disease stages is hard to achieve with a conventional random treatment
  allocation procedure, as poor treatments cause deterioration of subject health.
  We therefore aim to design an adaptive allocation strategy to improve the efficiency
  of data collection by allocating more samples for exploring promising treatments.
  We cast this application as a contextual bandit problem and introduce a simple and
  practical algorithm for exploration-exploitation in this framework. The work builds
  on a recent class of approaches for non-contextual bandits that relies on subsampling
  to compare treatment options using an equivalent amount of information. On the technical
  side, we extend the subsampling strategy to the case of bandits with context, by
  applying subsampling within Gaussian Process regression. On the experimental side,
  preliminary results using 10 mice with skin tumours suggest that the proposed approach
  extends by more than 50% the subjects life duration compared with baseline strategies:
  no treatment, random treatment allocation, and constant chemotherapeutic agent.
  By slowing the tumour growth rate, the adaptive procedure gathers information about
  treatment effectiveness on a broader range of tumour volumes, which is crucial for
  eventually deriving sequential pharmacological treatment strategies for cancer.'
