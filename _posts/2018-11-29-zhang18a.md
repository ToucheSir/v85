abstract: Predicting diagnoses from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is an important
  medical application of multi-label learning. We propose a convolutional residual
  model for multi-label classification from doctor notes in EHR data. A given patient
  may have multiple diagnoses, and therefore multi-label learning is required. We
  employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to encode plain text into a fixed-length
  sentence embedding vector. Since diagnoses are typically correlated, a deep residual
  network is employed on top of the CNN encoder, to capture label (diagnosis) dependencies
  and incorporate information directly from the encoded sentence vector. A real EHR
  dataset is considered, and we compare the proposed model with several well-known
  baselines, to predict diagnoses based on doctor notes. Experimental results demonstrate
  the superiority of the proposed convolutional residual model.
