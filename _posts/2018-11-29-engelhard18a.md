abstract: Health risks from cigarette smoking – the leading cause of preventable death
  in the United States – can be substantially reduced by quitting. Although most smokers
  are motivated to quit, the majority of quit attempts fail. A number of studies have
  explored the role of self-reported symptoms, physiologic measurements, and environmental
  context on smoking risk, but less work has focused on the temporal dynamics of smoking
  events, including daily patterns and related nicotine effects. In this work, we
  examine these dynamics and improve risk prediction by modeling smoking as a self-triggering
  process, in which previous smoking events modify current risk. Specifically, we
  fit smoking events self-reported by 42 smokers to a time-varying semi-parametric
  Hawkes process (TV-SPHP) developed for this purpose. Results show that the TV-SPHP
  achieves superior prediction performance compared to related and existing models,
  with incorporation of time-varying predictors having greatest benefit over longer
  prediction windows. Moreover, the impact function illustrates previously unknown
  temporal dynamics of smoking, with possible connections to nicotine metabolism to
  be explored in future work through a randomized study design. By more effectively
  predicting smoking events and exploring a self-triggering component of smoking risk,
  this work supports development of novel or improved cessation interventions that
  aim to reduce death from smoking.
