abstract: Knowledge-based planning (KBP) is an automated approach to radiation therapy
  treatment planning that involves predicting desirable treatment plans before they
  are then corrected to deliverable ones. We propose a generative adversarial network
  (GAN) approach for predicting desirable 3D dose distributions that eschews the previous
  paradigms of site-specific feature engineering and predicting low-dimensional representations
  of the plan. Experiments on a dataset of oropharyngeal cancer patients show that
  our approach significantly outperforms previous methods on several clinical satisfaction
  criteria and similarity metrics.
