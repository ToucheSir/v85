abstract: Survival prediction for cancer patients can increase the prognostic accuracy
  and might ultimately lead to better informed decision making. To this end, many
  studies apply machine learning to cancer data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
  and End Results (SEER) program. The first part of this report contains a literature
  review to obtain a systematic overview of these studies. We identify 34 publications
  and extract information about experimental setups and efforts to ensure reproducibility.
  The review shows that only one of the identified studies mentions reproducibility
  and no study contains straightforward reproducible results. This motivates the second
  part of this work. We demonstrate the feasibility of reproducible cohort selection
  and survival prediction with SEER cancer data. Experiments are performed for 1-
  and 5-year survival of breast and lung cancer with cases diagnosed between 2004
  and 2009. We compare minimal data preprocessing with 1-n encoding of categorical
  inputs and apply logistic regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. Encoding
  with 1-n vectors proves beneficial throughout all experiments. For lung cancer,
  MLP models show a slightly superior performance. Moreover, importance of input attributes
  is analyzed with logistic regression weights and ablation analysis for MLPs.
