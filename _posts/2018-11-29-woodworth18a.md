abstract: As robots become more affordable and more common in everyday life, particularly
  in assistive contexts, there will be an ever-increasing demand for adaptive behavior
  that is personalized to the individual needs of users. To accomplish this, robots
  will need to learn about their users’ unique preferences through interaction. Current
  preference learning techniques lack the ability to infer long-term, task-independent
  preferences in realistic, interactive, incomplete-information settings. To address
  this gap, we introduce a novel preference-inference formulation, inspired by assistive
  robotics applications, in which a robot must infer these kinds of preferences based
  only on observing the user’s behavior in various tasks. We then propose a candidate
  inference algorithm based on maximum-margin methods, and evaluate ts performance
  in the context of robot-assisted prehabilitation. We find that the algorithm learns
  to predict aspects of the user’s behavior as it is given more data, and that it
  shows strong convergence properties after a small number of iterations.
