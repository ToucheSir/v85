abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain an overwhelming amount of information
  about each patient, making it difficult for clinicians to quickly find the most
  salient information. Accurate, concise summarization of relevant data can help alleviate
  this cognitive burden. In practice, clinical narrative notes serve this purpose
  during the course of care, but they are only intermittently updated and are sometimes
  missing information. We address this problem by learning to generate topics that
  should be in summaries of structured health record data at any point during a stay.
  We use the detailed, high-dimensional structured data to predict existing clinical
  note topics. Our model can generate topics based on structured health record data,
  even when a real note does not exist. We demonstrate that using structured data
  alone, we are able to generate note topics comparable to the performance of using
  prior notes alone. Our method is also capable of generating the first note in the
  stay. We demonstrate that our predicted topic distributions are meaningful using
  the downstream task of predicting in-hospital mortality. We show that our generated
  note topic vectors perform comparably or even outperform topics from the actual
  notes on predicting in-hospital mortality.
