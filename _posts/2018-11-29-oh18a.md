abstract: Recently, researchers have started applying convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs) with one-dimensional convolutions to clinical tasks involving time-series
  data. This is due, in part, to their computational efficiency, relative to recurrent
  neural networks and their ability to efficiently exploit certain temporal invariances,
  (\textit{e.g.}, phase invariance). However, it is well-established that clinical
  data may exhibit many other types of invariances (\textit{e.g.}, scaling). While
  preprocessing techniques, (\textit{e.g.,} dynamic time warping) may successfully
  transform and align inputs, their use often requires one to identify the types of
  invariances in advance. In contrast, we propose the use of Sequence Transformer
  Networks, an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to identify and account
  for invariances in clinical time-series data. Applied to the task of predicting
  in-hospital mortality, our proposed approach achieves an improvement in the area
  under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) relative to a baseline
  CNN (AUROC=0.851 vs. AUROC=0.838). Our results suggest that a variety of valuable
  invariances can be learned directly from the data.
