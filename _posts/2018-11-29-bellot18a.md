abstract: We present a new approach to ensemble learning for risk prognosis in heterogeneous
  medical populations. Our aim is to improve overall prognosis by focusing on under-represented
  patient subgroups with an atypical disease presentation; with current prognostic
  tools, these subgroups are being consistently mis-estimated. Our method proceeds
  sequentially by learning nonparametric survival estimators which iteratively learn
  to improve predictions of previously misdiagnosed patients - a process called boosting.
  This results in fully nonparametric survival estimates, that is, constrained neither
  by assumptions regarding the baseline hazard nor assumptions regarding the underlying
  covariate interactions - and thus differentiating our approach from existing boosting
  methods for survival analysis. In addition, our approach yields a measure of the
  relative covariate importance that accurately identifies relevant covariates within
  complex survival dynamics, thereby informing further medical understanding of disease
  interactions. We study the properties of our approach on a variety of heterogeneous
  medical datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing
  survival and ensemble methods.
