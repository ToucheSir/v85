abstract: Medical data are not missing at random. The problem is more acute when the
  observations are over an extended period of time; any particular variable is observed
  at relatively few time points. We taking missing values to be the norm, and treat
  “presentness” (the times of observations) as additional features to augment the
  values observed. A joint model over both avoids the “missing at random” assumption.
  We use piecewise-constant conditional intensity models (PCIMs) to build a generative
  model of observation times and values. We demonstrate its effectiveness in reconstruction
  of monitor readings of patient vitals from sparse EHR data.
