abstract: 'The high prevalence of spinal stenosis results in a large volume of MRI
  imaging, yet interpretation can be time-consuming with high inter-reader variability
  even among the most specialized radiologists. In this paper, we develop an efficient
  methodology to leverage the subject-matter-expertise stored in large-scale archival
  reporting and image data for a deep-learning approach to fully-automated lumbar
  spinal stenosis grading. Specifically, we introduce three major contributions: (1)
  a natural-language-processing scheme to extract level-by-level ground-truth labels
  from free-text radiology reports for the various types and grades of spinal stenosis
  (2) accurate vertebral segmentation and disc-level localization using a U-Net architecture
  combined with a spine-curve fitting method, and (3) a multi-input, multi-task, and
  multi-class convolutional neural network to perform central canal and foraminal
  stenosis grading on both axial and sagittal imaging series inputs with the extracted
  report-derived labels applied to corresponding imaging level segments. This study
  uses a large dataset of 22796 disc-levels extracted from 4075 patients. We achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on lumbar spinal stenosis classification and expect
  the technique will increase both radiology workflow efficiency and the perceived
  value of radiology reports for referring clinicians and patients.'
