abstract: Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are some of the highest intensity areas of patient
  care activities in hospitals, yet documentation and understanding of the occurrence
  of these activities remains sub-optimal due in part to already-demanding patient
  care workloads of nursing staff. Recently, computer vision based methods operating
  over color and depth data collected from passive mounted sensors have been developed
  for automated activity recognition, but have been limited to coarse or simple activities
  due to the complex environments in ICUs, where fast-changing activities and severe
  occlusion occurs. In this work, we introduce an approach for tackling more challenging
  activities in ICUs by combining depth data from multiple sensors to form a single
  3D point cloud representation, and using a neural network-based model to reason
  over this 3D representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using
  a dataset of mobility-related patient care activities collected in a clinician-guided
  simulation setting.
