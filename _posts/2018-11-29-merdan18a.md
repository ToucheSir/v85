abstract: We combine predictive modeling techniques from machine learning and optimization
  methods to design coordinated imaging protocols for detection of metastatic cancer.
  Our approach considers different combinations of imaging tests to reduce imaging
  while also ensuring that the average risk of missing a metastatic cancer in the
  population does not exceed a desirable threshold. To account for the imperfect calibration
  of probability estimates obtained from predictive models, we formulate the decision
  problem of determining the optimal assignment of patients to imaging protocols as
  a robust mixed-integer program. Furthermore, we propose fast, easy-to-understand
  and clinically motivated approximation algorithms that can mitigate the effects
  of statistical error in predictions. We illustrate the practical performance of
  the proposed approximation algorithms and optimization models based on medical data
  collected by a large state-wide prostate cancer collaborative. The work presented
  in this article will help lay the groundwork to improve medical decision making
  by integrating machine learning and optimization in other disease areas.
