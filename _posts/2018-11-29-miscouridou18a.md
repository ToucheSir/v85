abstract: Clinical care requires understanding the time to medical events. Medical
  events include the time to a disease like chronic kidney disease progressing or
  the time to a complication as in stroke for high blood pressure. Models for event
  times live in the framework provided by survival analysis. We expand on deep survival
  analysis, a deep generative model for survival analysis in the presence of missing
  data, where the survival times are modeled using Weibull distributions. We develop
  methods to relax the distributional assumptions in deep survival analysis using
  survival distributions that can approximate any true survival function. We show
  that the model structure mimics the information-optimal procedure in the presence
  of missing data. Our experiments demonstrate that moving to flexible survival functions
  yields better likelihoods and concordances for coronary heart disease prediction
  from electronic health records.
