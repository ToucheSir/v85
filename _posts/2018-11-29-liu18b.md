abstract: 'Early detection of preventable diseases is important for better disease
  management, improved interventions, and more efficient health-care resource allocation.
  Various machine learning approaches have been developed to exploit information in
  Electronic Health Record (EHR) for this task. Majority of previous attempts, however,
  focus on structured fields and lose the vast amount of information in the unstructured
  notes.  In this work we propose a general multi-task framework for disease onset
  prediction that combines both free-text medical notes and structured information.
  We compare performance of different deep learning architectures including CNN, LSTM
  and hierarchical models. In contrast to traditional text-based prediction models,
  our approach does not require disease specific feature engineering, and can handle
  negations and numerical values that exist in the text. Our results on a cohort of
  about 1 million patients show that models using text outperform models using just
  structured data, and that models capable of using numerical values and negations
  in the text, in addition to the raw text, further improve performance. Additionally,
  we compare different visualization methods for medical professionals to interpret
  model predictions. '
