abstract: 'There are established racial disparities in healthcare, including during
  end-of-life care, when poor communication and trust can lead to suboptimal outcomes
  for patients and their families. In this work, we find that racial disparities which
  have been reported in existing literature are also present in the MIMIC-III database.
  We hypothesize that one underlying cause of this disparity is due to mistrust between
  patient and caregivers, and we develop multiple possible trust metric proxies (using
  coded interpersonal variables and clinical notes) to measure this phenomenon more
  directly. These metrics show even stronger disparities in end-of-life care than
  race does, and they also tend to demonstrate statistically significant higher levels
  of mistrust for black patients than white ones. Finally, we demonstrate that these
  metrics improve performance on three clinical tasks: in-hospital mortality, discharge
  against medical advice (AMA) and modified care status (e.g., DNR, DNI, etc.).'
