abstract: The localization of epileptic zone in pharmacoresistant focal epileptic
  patients is a daunting task, typically performed by medical experts through visual
  inspection over highly sampled neural recordings. For a finer localization of the
  epileptogenic areas and a deeper understanding of the pathology both the identification
  of pathogenical biomarkers and the automatic characterization of epileptic signals
  are desirable. In this work we present a data integration learning method based
  on multi-level representation of stereo-electroencephalography recordings and multiple
  kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to tackle
  both aspects simultaneously, as our approach is devised to classify critical vs.
  non-critical recordings while detecting the most discriminative frequency bands.
  The learning pipeline is applied to a data set of 18 patients for a total of 2347
  neural recordings analyzed by medical experts. Without any prior knowledge assumption,
  the data-driven method reveals the most discriminative frequency bands for the localization
  of epileptic areas in the high-frequency spectrum (>=80 Hz) while showing high performance
  metric scores (mean balanced accuracy of 0.89 +- 0.03). The promising results may
  represent a starting point for the automatic search of clinical biomarkers of epileptogenicity.
