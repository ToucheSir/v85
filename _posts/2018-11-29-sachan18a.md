abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in text
  mining of medical documents and has many applications. Deep learning based approaches
  to this task have been gaining increasing attention in recent years as their parameters
  can be learned end-to-end without the need for hand-engineered features. However,
  these approaches rely on high-quality labeled data, which is expensive to obtain.
  To address this issue, we investigate how to use unlabeled text data to improve
  the performance of NER models. Specifically, we train a bidirectional language model
  (BiLM) on unlabeled data and transfer its weights to ?pretrain? an NER model with
  the same architecture as the BiLM, which results in a better parameter initialization
  of the NER model. We evaluate our approach on four benchmark datasets for biomedical
  NER and show that it leads to a substantial improvement in the F1 scores compared
  with the state-of-the-art approaches. We also show that BiLM weight transfer leads
  to a faster model training and the pretrained model requires fewer training examples
  to achieve a particular F1 score.
