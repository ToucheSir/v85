abstract: Access to electronic health record (EHR) data has motivated computational
  advances in medical research. However, various concerns, particularly over privacy,
  can limit access to and collaborative use of EHR data. Sharing synthetic EHR data
  could mitigate risk. In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative
  Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic patient records. Based
  on input real patient records, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables
  (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative
  adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode
  collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut
  connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic
  patient records that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments
  including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and a medical expert
  review. We also empirically observe a limited privacy risk in both identity and
  attribute disclosure using medGAN.
