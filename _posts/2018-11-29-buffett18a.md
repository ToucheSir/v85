abstract: 'This paper presents the results of an analytics-based study to determine
  key differences in junior resident level and expert level surgical skill when engaging
  with a neurosurgical simulator. Window-based time series discretization and sequential
  pattern analysis were used on positional data to identify frequent movement patterns
  and instrumentation techniques associated with each skill class. Cross-validation
  confirmed that a Bayesian classification model constructed using these patterns
  can be used to predict skill level with a high degree of confidence and accuracy
  on a small sample of neurosurgeons who engaged with the simulator. An analysis of
  movement speed also revealed that the junior residents exhibited a high degree of
  very slow and very fast movements, whereas the expert surgeons displayed a significantly
  more consistent technique of moderate-speed movements. Finally, the analysis was
  integrated within a cloud-based learning framework, helping to provide beneficial
  feedback on movement proficiency to resident surgeons in training. The presented
  work makes two key contributions to the field of machine learning in the medical
  field: the study 1) employs a low-level behaviour-based analysis of surgical technique,
  as opposed to high-level summary metrics such as blood loss and average force, and
  2) avoids the use of expert information on neurosurgical skill within the AI engine,
  and thus employs an analysis that is entirely uninformed.'
