abstract: Expert diagnostic support systems have been extensively studied. The practical
  applications of these systems in real-world scenarios have been somewhat limited
  due to well-understood shortcomings, such as lack of extensibility. More recently,
  machine-learned models for medical diagnosis have gained momentum, since they can
  learn and generalize patterns found in very large datasets like electronic health
  records. These models also have shortcomings - in particular, there is no easy way
  to incorporate prior knowledge from existing literature or experts. In this paper,
  we present a method to merge both approaches by using expert systems as generative
  models that create simulated data on which models can be learned. We demonstrate
  that such a learned model not only preserves the original properties of the expert
  systems but also addresses some of their limitations. Furthermore, we show how this
  approach can also be used as the starting point to combine expert knowledge with
  knowledge extracted from other data sources, such as electronic health records.
