abstract: Cytometry is an important single cell analysis technology in furthering
  our understanding of cellular biological processes and in supporting clinical diagnoses
  across a variety hematological and immunological conditions. Current data analysis
  workflows for cytometry data rely on a manual process called gating to classify
  cells into canonical types. This dependence on human annotation significantly limits
  the rate, reproducibility, and scope of cytometryâ€™s use in both biological research
  and clinical practice. We develop a novel Bayesian approach for automated gating
  that classifies cells into different types by combining cell-level marker measurements
  with an informative prior. The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of
  biologically-meaningful prior information that captures the domain expertise of
  human experts. The inference algorithm results in a hierarchically-structured classification
  of individual cells in a manner that mimics the tree-structured recursive process
  of manual gating, making the results readily interpretable. The approach can be
  extended in a natural fashion to handle data from multiple different samples by
  the incorporation of random effects in the Bayesian model. The proposed approach
  is evaluated using mass cytometry data, on the problems of unsupervised cell classification
  and supervised clinical diagnosis, illustrating the benefits of both incorporating
  prior knowledge and sharing information across multiple samples.
