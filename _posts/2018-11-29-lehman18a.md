abstract: The high rate of intensive care unit false arrhythmia alarms can lead to
  disruption of care and slow response time due to desensitization of clinical staff.
  We study the use of machine learning models to detect false ventricular tachycardia
  (v-tach) alarms using ECG waveform recordings. We propose using a Superv sed Denoising
  Autoencoder (SDAE) to detect false alarms using a low-dimensional representation
  of ECG dynamics learned by minimizing a combined reconstruct on and classification
  loss. We evaluate our algorithms on the PhysioNet Challenge 2015 dataset, containing
  over 500 records (over 300 training and 200 testing) with v-tach alarms. Our results
  indicate that using the SDAE on Fast Fourier Transformed (FFT) ECG at a beat-by-beat
  level outperforms several competitive baselines on the task of v-tach false alarm
  classification. We show that it is important to exploit the underlying known physiological
  structure using beat-by-beat frequency distribution from multiple cardiac cycles
  of the ECG waveforms to obtain competitive results and improvement over previous
  entries from the 2015 PhysioNet Challenge.
