abstract: Unstructured learning problems without well-defined rewards are unsuitable
  for current reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Action-derived rewards can allow
  RL agents to fully explore state and action trade-offs in scenarios that require
  specific outcomes yet are unstructured by external reward. Clinical trial dosing
  choice is an example of such a problem. We report the successful formulation of
  clinical trial dosing choice as an RL problem using action-based rewards and learning
  of dosing regimens to reduce mean tumor diameters (MTD) in patients undergoing simulated
  temozolomide (TMZ) and procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea,
  and vincristine (PCV) chemo- and radiotherapy clinical trials. The use of action-derived
  rewards as partial proxies for outcomes is described for the first time. Novel dosing
  regimens learned by an RL agent in the presence of action-derived rewards achieve
  significant reduction in MTD for cohorts and individual patients in simulated TMZ
  and PCV clinical trials while reducing treatment cycle administrations and dosage
  concentrations compared to human-expert dosing regimens. Our approach can be easily
  adapted for other learning tasks where outcome-based learning is not practical.
